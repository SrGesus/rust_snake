# rust_snake

A simple snake game built in rust using minifb.

# How to play
Assuming you have git and cargo installed, the game can be easily downloaded and compiled by entering:
```
git clone https://github.com/SrGesus/rust_snake
cd rust_snake
cargo run
```
Then using the arrow keys, WASD, or vim keys, try to eat the apple as the snake to grow, without hitting yourself or the walls.
